            <p>'Designer' is not just my title - it is who I am! <br> From research to design thinking, through concept
                development and final design details. I have been working across different channels with projects
                throughout the entire product life-cycle.
                Understanding human factors, functionality and focus on the user-centered design process, with a great
                interest in the way things work.</p>
