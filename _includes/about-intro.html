            <p>From research to design thinking to fine illustrations. I have been working on diverse projects throughout the entire product life-cycle, 
                ranging from consumers to large corporate enterprises. I approach each project with a user-centered mindset, 
                ensuring that the end result is not only visually appealing but also highly functional and user-friendly.
                Understanding human factors, functionality and focus on the user-centered design process.
