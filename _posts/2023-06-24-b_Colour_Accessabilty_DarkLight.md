### Colour and Accessibility - Dark and Light Themes Background
<br>

#### OVERVIEW

<br>


In 2019, Apple and Google introduced Dark mode themes for their OS, revolutionizing the way users interact with their devices. Since then, dark mode options have become increasingly popular, with many apps adopting this design. The shift to dark mode has also brought various advantages, for potential battery life improvements making it easier for anyone to use a device in a low-light environment.

Even when Dark Mode wasn't yet a thing, it still existed on the BalckBerry Devices. The concept of dark mode isn't entirely new, as it traces its roots back to the early days of computing when the first computer screens were already in "dark mode."

However, it gained significant traction when major tech giants officially integrated it. Beforethe computers, our eyes got used to reading books with dark text on a white background. Saying that, this was when we were working and studying during the day and sleeping at night.

#### LEARNINGS 

Nowadays, when we use our devices around the clock, users want to have the possibility to customize their devices, giving their eyes a rest especially during night time use.Dark mode makes devices in low-light environments more comfortable by reducing glare and preserving night vision. 


Working a lot with developers, it seems like Dark mode has proven to be highly beneficial. Beyond providing much-needed relief to their eyes during extended screen time, it also enhances the overall coding experience. The color-coded elements in dark mode allow developers to quickly discern the code structure, making it easier to identify and differentiate components. This feature enables them to scan through code rapidly, improving productivity and reducing the time spent on reading each line.

#### ACCESSABILITY 

The introduction of dark mode themes marked a significant turning point in user experience. Dark mode has evolved into a popular choice for its numerous benefits. But not everyone may feel more comfortable, less tired and more focused while using Dark Mode. Designing for a dark background requires specific accessibility guidelines to consider. I see many products that move into dark mode but neglacting accessabilty ratio.
<br>
Color contrast and tones used on a dark theme are vital for all users but especially for people with poor vision or disabilities. Users must be able to perceive content. This is why colors selected for text and icons need to be contrasted, readable and carefully used if there are gradients, semi-transparent colors, and background images. Everything has to be designed carefully and meet the contrast requirements.

It's essential to consider the different content levels on a dark mode, especially with a card-based design. Shadows cannot be perceived the same as with the light theme. I have been experimenting with different shades of grey that can help to communicate visual hierarchy. Avoiding using 100% black because pure black is too hard on the eye.  

Accessibility is something I never skip, especially for a dark mode design. For example, saturated colors should be avoided and darker tone colors like red or brown might be hard to read and they don't pass WCAG's accessibility standard. Working on many projects parallely, I always make sure to check myself.  There are helpful websites that color accessibility could be tested.

###### Dark Theme Guidelines [Designed for BlackBerry Products](/dark-theme)  
<br>


[WEBAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/){:target="_blank"} and [Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/){:target="_blank"} have a contrast ratio checker for text and graphic objects. You can enter a foreground and background color in RGB hex format or choose a color using the color picker.  And it will give you ratio results for WCAG AA and WCAG AAA.

When designing a product, I constantly research industry standards and competitors, considering brand values, target audience and usability requirements. While creating the Dark Theme Guidelines for BlackBerry Products, I also had the opportunity to investigate the different aspects and challenges of accessibility. Dark mode has evolved a lot but still can create many accessibility issues. For some people, dark themes are more accessible, for others, the white background would be preferable. The bottom line, users need to have customization and have both a dark theme and a light theme and allow users to select the theme that works best for them. Make switching between dark themes and light themes obvious and easy to find.

Design is about functionality, and more thought should be given to accessible color choices when designing using a dark or a light theme. 
The goal is to create products that will be easy to use, accessible for everyone and effective. Ensuring trustful and positive experience from the user's perspective and company's impression.
