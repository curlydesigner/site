#### Overview:
 
 SecuSUITE is part of BlackBerry Security; it's a high-security Voice and Messaging app for iOS and Android. Available for government and Enterprise use. I was involved from start to finish, from redesigning a logo aligned with the Blackberry brand to enhancing the info-architecture based on research insights. Creating wireframes tailored to various platforms
 
 And expanding the [Design System](/colour-accessibility) I had created to ensure a unified brand experience across all products.

#### Research | Testing | Competitive Analysis and Brainstorming

  I gathered feedback to pinpoint the target audience's needs and collaborated with my team to brainstorm solutions. I tested the app, focusing on user interactions, usability, errors, and visual clarity through heuristic evaluation. My role involved analyzing performance, identifying improvement areas, and proposing actionable recommendations. I explored various communication and messaging apps to understand their features, interactions, UI, and visual design elements, aiming to enhance our app's user experience.
