###### Player's Journey Map

### 4X GAME MAIN HUD NAVIGATION 

#### IXD | USER FLOW | INFO-ARCHITECTURE | SIZE GUIDE RECOMMENDATION | FUNCTIONALITY PROTOTYPE  

<br>

#### Overview:
 

While working in WB Games I was involved in exploring Main HUD Navigation for a 4X strategy game. Working with cross-functional team members to research and develop user flows, info-architecture, wireframes, mockups, and prototypes.
In this type of strategy game the focuse involve managing and growing an empire, exploring a game world, and making strategic decisions to achieve victory. 

<br> 


#### Screens and Features I was involved in:

<br>

- Main HUD and Navigantion - [UX Size Guide and Accessabilty](/wb-accessibility)
- A Map -  where players can see the entire game world and explore different tiles, castles and armies.
- UI Elements and navigation throughout the game.
Interactions include:
Selecting a tile.
Researching and exploring ownership.
Acting to improve resource management and expanding an empire.
- Queast and Objective system - where a player can see a list of their objectives and interact, taking steps in progress throughout the game. 
- Empire Management and resources, like food production, manage their city, dragons and make other strategic decisions.
- Combat Screen - where players can engage in battles with other dragons, manage their resources, and make tactical decisions. 
- Victory Screen - where players can view their progress towards victory conditions and see which dragons are leading the game. 
- Chat - where players can interact with other players and engage in diplomacy and trade. 

<br>


#### Information Architecture 


<br>

![information-architecture](/assets/posts/2023-06-31-p_wb-4x/wb-i-a_hud.png "information-architecture")


<br>

This map was created for a logical and easy-to-follow structure that allows players to access different sections efficiently. 
Exploring other game HUDs and looking to simplifying navigation to help players quickly locate the information they need and understand the game space they're in. 

<br> Top Bar focuses on the player, allowing the player to explore their character and see who they are in the gameplay.
Also, explore the world beyond the map and setup their game settings.
Left side focuses on the player's goals, while on the right, where the player can take action. 
In my design considiration the main most important elements/links located on the sides of the screen and are adapted for maximum thumb-finger size tap.

<br>

#### UX Goals and Challanges

<br>

- Simplifying Complexity 
4X games pose unique challenges with complex systems while managing many features and data simultaneously. I’ve come to understand that one of the common challenges in such complex games is the need to present a vast amount of information within the constraints of a small mobile screen. 

- Progressive Complexity - 
Another challenge is how to delicate balance to gradually introduce game mechanics and features,  especially in the early stages of the game. Avoid overwhelming the player with too much information all at once. 

- Aiming to all Levels - 
Striking to engage different player knowledge and levels. This balance becomes even more critical as it aims to both players who appreciate the complexity and those who prefer a more straightforward puzzle gaming experience.

- Intutivie Data and clear User interface (UI) that provides organized information about each of the screens and overall easy navigation theough out the game. 
UI that allows for players to explore, what is a tile on a map? Who is th owner and how to own a tile? How to manage their resources and City/Castle?
- Design a mini version and full version of a Quest sytem, with interaction, visualisation to get real time feedback and a list that helps to progreess through out the game. 
- Explore and test accessibility, icon size, typography and visual hierarchy using tooltips, colors, icons and information that effectively convey critical details and exciting message to engage the player.

###### UX - Wireframes proposal for 4X Main HUD Navigation

<br>

#### Main Header Navigation - Top Bar

The HUD consist a top bar with elements that are persistent and show over top the scene. It will continue to be displayed when a player is on the map and other screen.  
While the location of the top bar remains static, its content is customizable and will change slightly based on the specific screen or section the player interacts with. This customization allows for dynamic and contextually relevant information to be displayed, enhancing the user experience and providing relevant feedback or options.

Header (top bar) on the Tile Map will includes the below links and information:

- Link to Player’s Profile
- Link to choose a Planet from a Galaxy map
- Search options 
- The Game Settings 


![topbar](assets/posts/2023-06-31-p_wb-4x/topbar.png "topbar")


The components of the Header - when player inside of local navigation screen are:

- Go Back; The Back button allows the player to easily navigate back to the map from the local navigation panel. It provides a straightforward and intuitive way for users to return to the previous screen they were viewing.

- Page Title; The page title in the header should indicate the current location or purpose of the local navigation panel. It should provide a clear and descriptive label to help players understand where they are within the overall navigation structure. It can assists in orienting the player and reinforces the context of the content they are interacting with.


![topbar](assets/posts/2023-06-31-p_wb-4x/topbar-1.png "topbar")


To allow easy navigation for players and consistency the decision made have just one link : back or close button, not having both.
- Back button will appear in any full screen layout to provide a simple and intuitive behavior for players to go back.

- Close button will be used to dismiss or close an element or small screen and return the user to the main view. The Close button provides a focused and targeted interaction for users to exit a specific element, small pop outs, overly screens, information panels.

By incorporating these basic navigation rules, we ensure a clear and intuitive navigation between the different screens. And provide users with the necessary means to navigate, interact, and recover from potential navigational challenges.
<br>

#### Global Navigation on The Map


It is recommended to position the global navigation elements on the edges of the screen within the visibility area, as suggested by below UX/UI Size Guide Templates. 

This placement allows for efficient access to the navigation while leaving the center of the screen open for the player to interact with the map and observe ongoing interactions.
<br>


#### Info Panel


Player can see information panel or open a tool tip to show territory ownership. 

Encourage the player to progress with their territory.

Player can tap outside to close the panel.

#### Component Libarary

In 4X Games each colour has representation for the different tiles.

CHAT - drawer
Player can see a preview of the latest active chat
Player can open full slider screen to interact with the chat
Player can hide the chat preview if they dont like to see running text reminders

### Accessibility 

Accessibility is a significant impact on the user experience of players. 
Readability, text size, icons, touch target for actions, and spacing can affect the accessibility and usability of an interface. The challenge of displaying a large amount of information that needs to appear on a small mobile map,  gameplay,  means Navigation need to be simplified and clear from their layout and assessability. Therefore, I took the time to create guidelines and templates that can be followed to ensure optimal touch target usability. Text, images, icons, and other elements are clear and straightforward with considerable leveraging and ‘white space.’  
<br> 


![touch target](assets/posts/2023-06-31-p_wb-4x/wb_target.png "touch target")
###### The ideal target size for most users is around 48-50px in width and height. The minimum target size for a mobile screen button (for players using an index finger) should be at least 45x45px in width and height. But for some, this size might cover the visibility of the entire target. For players who are using their Thumb, 72px is the target area.
<br>

______________________

#### Not Accessible 

**Don’t** create actions and icons that are too small or too close to each other.
The distance and spacing between targets depend on the designed area but should take into consideration the largest finger size to prevent accidental touch.
By using smaller icons consider more spacing to prevent accidental touch
Elements that needs to touch each other needs to take into consideration the surrounding touch area
Elements have to be placed within the safety-marked area

![dont](assets/posts/2023-06-31-p_wb-4x/G_tilemap_dont1.png "dont")
###### Not accessible example; don't create actions and icons that are too small or too close to each other.

<br>


#### Good Examples

The design should be adapted for optimal screen size. Make sure actions are large enough and spaced out for reliable interaction. Different screen sizes may have convenient and hard-to-reach areas for tapping.
This is why bottom side buttons should be adapted for maximum thumb-finger size tap.
Targets that are frequently used or critical to the functionality should be placed within easy reach and should be larger than less important targets.

<br>

![dont](assets/posts/2023-06-31-p_wb-4x/G_tilemap_THUMBS.png "dont")
###### Elements on the side of the screen should be considered as a larger tappble area for thumb size fingers and placed within the safety-marked area. 

![dont](assets/posts/2023-06-31-p_wb-4x/G_tilemap_bf2.png "dont")
###### Icons in the middle of screen could be designed smaller for index size finger

![dont](assets/posts/2023-06-31-p_wb-4x/G_tilemap_bf1.png "dont")
###### Bottom side buttons should be adapted for maximum thumb-finger size tap.

<br>


The ideal tappable action menu size 48px plus 24px (minimum) space to get 72px finger target area.
Most important action located on the side adapted for thumbs size 72x72px
Bottom menu action items on a tile map should display not more then 3-4 most important actions, plus two larger side actions.

Calcualtion of maximum element sthat could fit into the screeen and its placement. 


![safety](assets/posts/2023-06-31-p_wb-4x/size-guide.png "safety")
###### Elements on the side of the screen should be considered as a larger tappble area for thumb size fingers and placed within the safety-marked area. 

<br>

But of course it is also all about being smart about the implementation of code to ensure a responsive design that can adapt to different screen sizes and optimize its layout, text, and icons dynamically based on the screen size and orientation of the device being used. Taking the time to talk through with developers about the technical solutions for Utilizing flexible layouts and consideration for elements to be inside the visual area of the screen. 

<br>


#### Txtures

When designing for Map territories, Textures can indeed play a crucial role in accessibility and easy identification, especially when it comes to colour blindness. 
By using textures, with the right visual contrast, patterns or gradients, it can provide tactile feedback to users with visual impairments. On a map it can help identify different territories or regions. 
For example rough texture could represent mountains, while a smooth texture could represent plains. 
Also consistent textures can represent different types of territories across various screens or components, users can quickly learn to associate specific textures with specific regions, making the map more intuitive and familiar to navigate.
It's important to strike a balance between aesthetics and usability.


<br>

#### Labels - How important are they ? 


- Labels help organize content, making it easier for users to locate specific information or navigate through. Consistent Navigation with labels may be helpful. With easy-to-read and clear-to-understand contextual visualization, cues can help users understand where they are and where they can go next.
- Labels next to buttons and icons describe their functions explicitly. This is beneficial for all users, including those with cognitive impairments or those who are not familiar with certain symbols or iconography.
- Also, labels provide essential information to screen readers and assistive technologies, enabling users with visual impairments to understand and interact with digital content. When elements are appropriately labeled, screen readers can announce the labels aloud, allowing users to navigate and access the content effectively.
- Without labels, users may struggle to understand what information is expected in each field, leading to errors and frustration.
- Labels play a role in providing clear error messages when something goes wrong. This is crucial for users to identify the problem and take appropriate action to correct it.

I learned that incorporating labels is an essential aspect of accessible design, regardless of the user's abilities or disabilities. Labels contribute to a more inclusive and user-friendly experience, making it easier for everyone to access and engage with digital interfaces and information.
