Venus TV
  
Entertainment and New Media television channel
  
Venus Television is an Entertainment- Asian Culture TV channel, for the UK, Europe, Asia and North America community. Delivering quality TV programs for the whole family, including: Bollywood movies, Breakfast show, Lifestyle and Childrenís programmes- on SKY.
  
Before Venus TV I was not familiar with the Asian celebrities and the Indian language. One of the challenges was to came up with ideas and designs that will communicate with this specific targeted audience, using the suitable concepts, harmonic colors, typography and layouts. At the same time interpreting the creative business needs and developing concepts to suit their goals.

I was working closely with the PR Executive and the Managing Director, designing through work with their briefs. Designing of online weekly newsletters. Graphic design for print of brochures/leaflets and business pack. Advertisements design to four major Asian magazines in the UK. In some projects, I was working with Producers, assisting with video editing and effects. Maintaining, advising and developing conceptual design for video and broadcast, set design and backgrounds.
