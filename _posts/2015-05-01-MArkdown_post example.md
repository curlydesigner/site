        <p class="text-center title"> Designer is not just my title - it is who I am!</p>     <p> Immersed in a rich palette of creativity & deep understanding of design principles & human-centered design.
            I have been breaking down complex design challenges into intuitive experiences - ensuring the result is
            highly functional,
            visually appealing, accessible, and meets product objectives. My design journey has been enriched not only
            by exploration and discovery but also
            through teaching and hands-on, holistic experience across the entire product life-cycle from concept to
            launch, working in both
            B2B and B2C sectors.
