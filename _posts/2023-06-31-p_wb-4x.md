### GAME MAIN HUD NAVIGATION 


#### IXD | USER FLOW | INFO-ARCHITECTURE | SIZE GUIDE RECOMMENDATION | FUNCTIONALITY PROTOTYPE  

<br>

#### Overview:

<br>
- 
Part of my work in WB Games I was involved working on exploring Main HUD Navigation for a 4X strategy game. In this type of strategy game the focuse on four core gameplay elements: Explore, Expand, Exploit, and Exterminate. These games often involve managing and growing an empire or civilization, exploring a game world, and making strategic decisions to achieve victory. In 4X games, the main screens typically include:


- A Map: where players can see the entire game world and explore different tiles, castles and armies.
- Players can also interact with other players and engage in diplomacy and trade. 
- Research Screen: The research screen is where players can select a tile and research, learn about a tile, take action and improve resource management and expanding an empire.
- Empire Management Screen: where players can manage their empire's resources, including food, production, and money. This screen allows players to build new structures and units, manage their city, dragons and make other strategic decisions.
- Combat Screen is where players can engage in battles with other dragons. Players can deploy their fleets, manage their resources, and make tactical decisions. 
- Victory Screen: where players can view their progress towards victory conditions and see which dragons are leading the game.

#### UX GOALS 

<br>

When it comes to user experience (UX) principles in 4X games, it involve complex systems and a wealth of information. Some of the gooals 

- To ensure that the user interface (UI) provides clear and organized information about resources. What is a tile? How to own a tile on a map ? 
- Use visual hierarchy, tooltips, and concise text to convey important information effectively.
- Progressive Complexity: Gradually introduce game mechanics and features to players, especially in the early stages. Avoid overwhelming them with too much information all at once. Provide tutorials, tooltips, and guided gameplay to help players understand and master the game's mechanics and systems over time.
