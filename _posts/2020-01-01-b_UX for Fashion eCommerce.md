### User Experience for Fashion eCommerce Websites

<br> ![Bride](/assets/posts/2020-01-b_ecommerce-websites/Bride.png)<br>

Now that the market has completely changed, many businesses are moving online. Making it easier to discover and purchase products from anywhere in the world. However, that means a website or an app is the first interaction between a seller and a potential customer. It's not just about having an e-commerce website or an online shop, but about a virtual relationship between a seller and a potential customer. It is about creating an experience that simplifies the processes, increasing efficiency and keeping customers engaged. 

With the explosion of content, sellers need to communicate their information quickly enough, as people are increasingly selective with their choices and look for good products and prices to make sure their money is spent well.  

Excellent user experience design is about the proper functionality and accessibility that is easy to use and navigate. Mobile or/and desktop experience that attracts the right people to a Brand and delivers values in a meaningful way. 
An appealing, user-friendly design; that attracts and invites users to shop. Making the purchasing process as intuitive as possible. 

Here are a few inspiring examples with quick and easy flow, where branding shines and the product is a king. 


 [Free people](https://www.freepeople.com/)- an online store that offers a simple grid layout, yet stunning large gorgeous photos of clothes and accessories. Without overwhelming with information on sales and prices.

  There are so many things to consider when building the perfect website experience. And a set of rules to help create a unified identity when connecting multiple elements of your Brand by defining your colors, your logo and, of course, your typography. 
Fonts may seem like a small thing, but it has a lot of power you should not underestimate when considering typography. Picking the right font can have a significant impact on the final look and feel of your website. But remember to be consistent throughout all your platforms and printed materials regarding color, style, font sizes, and the hierarchy. 
Free people used an excellent combination between custom handwritten typography and a modern sans/serif font. Which gives a balanced look that’s both timeless and modern and works perfectly with the freestyle concept.

  

I love [Desigual](https://www.desigual.com/en_CA/)! It is a simple design layout with a beautiful, large, full-width banner that immediately tells a story as you land on their homepage. The welcome message "Hello Summer" focuses on the new beachwear collection. And the scene of a jumping model on the summer beach background triggers emotions of fun, energetic and positive mood.

When designing a website, I constantly research the industry standards and competitors. I find it many times companies make the mistake of putting too much stuff and information on their home page. Some think that it provides them an advantage by letting the visitor see a lot at a glance. Overloading the visitor with information only makes it harder to find the necessary stuff at a given time. In any case, it is known that people scan quickly, looking for fixed points that can guide them to necessary points. The less unnecessary stuff displayed, the more efficient the process is. 
Good marketing may bring in some traffic, but good design and an enjoyable user experience improve user satisfaction. The goal is to create a website that will be easy to use, accessible and effective. Ensuring safety, leaving a trustful and positive experience from the user's perspective. All of those could influence the success of a company's website and the Brand's impression. You may not have a second chance to make a good first impression!
