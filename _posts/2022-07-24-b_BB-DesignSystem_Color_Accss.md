# Case Study: 
### Colour and Accessibility | Design System        
### Dark & Light Themes for BlackBerry HUB+ 

<br>

<br>

### Overview

<br>

Even when Dark Mode wasn't yet a thing, it still existed on the BalckBerry Devices. The concept of dark mode isn't entirely new, as it traces its roots back to the early days of computing when the first computer screens were already in "dark mode." 

Later on it gained significant traction when major tech giants Apple and Google officially integrated Dark mode themes for their OS. 
Since then, dark mode options have become increasingly popular, with many apps adopting this design. 

In my role, I was leading a comprehensive dark theme design system for all products within BlackBerry HUB+. 
This involved conducting a detailed case study and research to understand challenges related to dark theme usage. 
And developing design system guidelines to ensure accessibility and visual aesthetics were optimized for both dark and light backgrounds.

<br> 

### Learnings

<br>

In the era before the computers, our reading habbits were centered around books. Our eyes got used to reading with dark text on a white background. 
This was when we were working and studying during the daylight and sleeping at night. 
Nowadays, when we use our devices around the clock, users want to have the possibility to customize their devices, giving their eyes a rest, especially during nighttime use. 
Dark mode makes devices in low-light environments more comfortable by reducing glare and preserving night vision. 
The shift to dark mode has also brought various advantages, for potential battery life improvements making it easier for anyone to use a device in a low-light environment. 

<br>

From my extensive collaboration with developers, and asking their preferences, it seems like Dark mode has proven to be highly beneficial when coding. 
Beyond providing much-needed relief to their eyes during extended screen time, it also enhances the entire coding experience. 
It's interesting how the color-coded elements both in dark and light mode allow developers quickly understadning of code structure, making component identification and differentiation a seamless process. This enables them to scan through code rapidly, improving productivity and cutting down the time spent on line-by-line code analysis.

### Dark Theme Challenges

<br>
- **Text Legibility and Color Contrast:**

  **Challenge:** In dark theme design, text can be challenging to read if color choices and contrast levels are not carefully considered. 

  **Solution:** I was conducting thorough testing to ensure sufficient color contrast, adhering to established accessibility guidelines. 
  Use fonts that are easy to read in low-light conditions. with unified Brand colour pallate that is adjuusted to Light vs Dark themes. 


- **Text Legibility and Color Contrast:**

  **Challenge:** Colors may behave differently on light and dark backgrounds, which demands a well-thought-out color palette to keep Brand Identity.

  **Solution:** I was working through carful colour pallete to have a consistent Brand Identity. Designing a color palette specifically tailored for dark themes and light themes, ensuring that it effectively communicates the intended message and consitent with the Brand.


- **Cluttered Interfaces:**

  **Challenge:** Dark UI designs can become cluttered quickly due to the absence of "white space" present in light themes.

  **Solution:** Prioritize clean and minimalist design. Carefully consider the spacing between elements to avoid overcrowding. Maintain visual hierarchy through well-defined layouts and grouping of related elements.


- **User Preferences:**

  **Challenge:** Not everyone prefers dark themes, which can create a challenge in satisfying a diverse user base.

  **Solution:** Offer users the option to switch between light and dark themes. Provide clear instructions on how to make the switch in the user interface settings, allowing users to personalize their experience.

### Accessibilty

<br>
Creating an inclusive experience requires careful consideration of color exploration and an understanding of various design principles that prioritize accessibility and diminish the reliance on color as the sole conveyor of critical information.

<br>

- **Visual Hierarchy** 
  Exploring card-based design in dark themes, I learned that maintaining visual hierarchy becomes essential.
  For example, shadows cannot be perceived the same as with the light theme background. Shadows play a significant role in conveying depth in UI, but their perception differs in dark backgrounds. I have been experimenting with different shades between Blacks and Greys to strike a balance and communicate effectively hierarchy that emphasizes elements based on their importance.

- **High Contrast Design:**
  Color contrast and tones used on a dark theme are vital for all users but especially for people with poor vision or colour blindness and disabilities. 
  Users must be able to perceive content. This is why opting for a high contrast design, especially in critical areas like text and icons. 
  Carefull use of gradients, semi-transparent colors, textures and background images.   

- **Avoiding Relying Solely on Color:**
  One valuable approach I've embraced when designing for colorblind individuals is, to begin with a monochrome black-and-white layout as the foundation.
  This deliberate choice ensures that essential information is clear, regardless of color perception. I used additional visual cues, such as labels, patterns, or icons, to provide context or differentiate elements. This ensures that users with color blindness can still comprehend content.

- **WCAG Checker**
  To ensure there is a sufficient contrast between text background and elements are visible at the right proportion I was checking the ratio requirments on with [WEBAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/){:target="_blank"} and [Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/){:target="_blank"} have a contrast ratio checker for text and graphic objects.

- **Testing Internaly with Users:**
  Conduct usability testing to get valuable insights into the user experience thst can help identify areas that may need improvement.

### Summary

When designing a product, I constantly research industry standards and competitors, considering brand values, target audience and usability requirements. While creating the Dark Theme Guidelines for BlackBerry Products, I also had the opportunity to investigate the different aspects and challenges of accessibility. Dark mode has evolved a lot but still can create many accessibility issues. Saturated colors should be used carefully, and darker-tone colors like red or brown might be hard to read. Those primarily found to be challenging to pass WCAG's accessibility standards. 
Overall, for some people, dark mode is more accessible, for others, the white background would be preferable. This is why, users need to have customization, having both a dark and a light mode allowing the users to choose and making the switch easy to find. 

Design is about functionality, and more thought should be given to accessible color choices when designing, both for dark and light screen modes. The goal is to create products that will be easy to use, accessible for everyone and effective. Ensuring a trustful and positive experience from the user's perspective and the company's impression.
