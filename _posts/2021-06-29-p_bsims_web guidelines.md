### Challenges

 I navigated numerous usability challenges in an environment where security is paramount and great focus and attention to detail are required. With a strong emphasis on simplifying complexity and designing a more intuitive navigation & user-friendly experience. 


 - Declutter the interface and information density without losing essential features.
 - Create a visual hierarchy, better focus, and easy navigation that simplifies the dozens of menu items but keeps functionality and performance.
 - Consistency in Branding & companyâ€™s values.
 - Clear Error and Communication Messages.

### Approach

 While I was the lead UX UI Designer on the portal - I worked closely with a Developer and Product owner to optimize the creation of the Design System for best performance.
 My approach involved creating info architecture, wireframe and iconography.


 - Implementing a minimalist design, balancing the use of colors with personalized iconiconography for each menu item so it is easily identifiable. Establishing a clear visual hierarchy to guide users naturally towards the most important elements and actions, while ensuring that all necessary information and functions are accessible.
 - Effective Navigation - ensuring the left-hand navigation panel allows users to see the full content and actions and organizing the menu items in a way that is intuitive and user-friendly. 
 - Integrating BlackBerry's brand values and color palette to resonate with the brand's identity and ethos.
