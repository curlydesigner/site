This communication app for social media platforms was designed for a start-up company targeted for a private Business group to allow internal communication. Wth Live streaming, news, games and entertaining and e-shopping experience. I was leading the design from start to finish. Researching competitors and industry standards, creating high-quality wireframes, prototypes, UI elements & interactive concepts. Creating a language that reflects a brand and injects functional design and friendly interaction. For both web, desktop and mobile devices for IOS and
Android. Editing videos, motion graphics for Live Stream.
