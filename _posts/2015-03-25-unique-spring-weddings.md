The Spring is officially here, the romantic Cherry Blossom season and 1st of April- which in many countries this day notable as being âApril Fools Dayâ â a day full of humor and jokes.ï¿½ The holiday season is a great time to plan your wedding.ï¿½ Personally, I was married on 1st of April andï¿½ we used the idea to add humor to our invitations and fun surprising features to our wedding event.ï¿½ Sometime those little touched make the differenceï¿½ for guests,ï¿½ addï¿½ to theï¿½ atmosphere and a mood for celebration.

**FROM COLORï¿½ PALETTES TO YOUR FIRST DANCE,
  
HERE ARE A FEW UNIQUE IDEAS FOR A FUN & ROMANTIC SPRING WEDDINGï¿½ ð**





The Bride&#8217;s dress is one of the peaks that guests would beï¿½ expecting to see &#8211;ï¿½ a refreshingï¿½ choiceï¿½ is to add some color to your dress. Weï¿½ surprised everyone with a Bride&#8217;s pink dress, inspired by the colors ofï¿½ Cherry Blossom. And a modern creamy white suiteï¿½ for the Groom with a light pink shirt. It isï¿½ a unique handwork that was ordered fromï¿½ Marisha Studioï¿½ & designed withï¿½ a combination of differentï¿½ shades of pink, a touch of gold and some light green beads,

In the beginning weï¿½ was not sure how the guest will take it, but everyone was surprised and the little unique ideas we added, appeared to be a hit with all our guests.

Another part in your wedding would be to plan your firstï¿½ dance style and melody. To find that one special song, the temp and the mood that is suites you both.ï¿½ It could beï¿½ a passionate Tango, a classic Waltsï¿½ or a simple Slow choreography, played live by a violinist, anyhowï¿½ it is a romantic moment that your guest will be exciting to see after the ceremony. This is a perfect timeï¿½ for you as a couple toï¿½ make a statement about your unique relationship, your memories or your dreams for the future. Andï¿½ after years of marriage it isï¿½ a nice memory to watch and remember.

You do not have to haveï¿½ a website, specially for your wedding event, but you canï¿½ create a beautiful website to reflect your love story with your photographs, videos and aï¿½ valuable resource for your guests.ï¿½ Putting information online so they can be updated, comment and greet you, especially for those who are abroad and from miles away. Itï¿½ can also reduce the amount of detail needed in your invitations, saving on printing and postage.

In this website I designedï¿½ a clean yet a gentle luxury look with a largeï¿½ couple&#8217;s picture of theirï¿½ romantic moment,ï¿½ with no words! It is a great photo of theï¿½ photographer Matthew Karant, he captured the couple&#8217;sï¿½ romantic moment of engagement in a beautiful compassion with a lot of light.



Thisï¿½ invitation is a combination between photography,ï¿½ composition &ï¿½ design I did for a modest couple who wanted to have something simpleï¿½ but yet unique personal touch. With aï¿½ gentle light blue palette, like (theï¿½ very not usual) tieï¿½ theï¿½ bride was wearing toï¿½ her ceremonyï¿½ in Prague.

This fun idea for a wedding invite is full of humor.ï¿½ The guests could walk the couple through the invite and recreate the storiesï¿½ and places that have made their relationship so special.
  
Great design by [Joel Derksen][2]





&#8216;A GARDEN FULL OF FLOWERS&#8217; &#8211; it is so obvious you will want to use flowers on your wedding, but [this couple][3] made it their inspiration for all.ï¿½ Simple yetï¿½ very gentle and romantic.
