### BLACKBERRY POWER CENTER APP 


#### IXD | USER FLOW | DESIGN PROPOSAL 

<br>

I was leading the design of Power Center App for BlackBerry HUB+ prodcuts. 
Including secure apps suite like; Secure Inbox, Calendar, Notes, Tasks, Password, Battery Power Center & other Guardian Security apps. 
I was responsible for creating design guidelines, wireframes, information architecture and user flows, involved throughout the entire product life-cycle, understanding human factors, functionality with focuses on usability and friendly interactions.
