, and more. 
I was executing briefs for all Brand elements in the business, making sketches and producing conceptual designs for specific commercial or promotional needs. 
Creating designs for an international audience, considering localization for different cultures, including a copy that was translated and published in more than 22 languages worldwide.

<br>In this example, the request was to design an international festive seasonal promotion for VIP Game Club Players. The players would enjoy an element of surprise, every time they collect a specific amount of points in the promo period. 
They receive a Card, which will award a random Bonus or a Prize.

<br>One of the challenges I faced was how to create a festive winter look and avoiding mentoring “Christmas” for different cultures and religions worldwide. But at the same time, the idea was to design a Winter Wonderland look and feel that at the same time supports the green colours of the Brand.

 <br>I created a night winter scene that feels frosty and frozen somewhere on the Northern Arctic with the Northern lights.
With an open gift box and “Hot Prizes” that melt in the snow.

Anotherï¿½ request was to design a Christmas Seasonal Promotion for VIP Poker Game Club Players in France. The players would enjoy an element of surprise, every time they collect specific amount of points in the promo period. They will receive a Card, which will award a random Bonus or Prize. I designed a green background, while the spiral shaped lights, that reminds a Christmas Tree in the middle of the banner, direct the focus of the attention, to attract the players with the prizes. I used a Green Branded colors with contrasted dark and lighted areas to highlight the prizes and the text: Christmas Wishlist
