Bwin.party Digital Entertainment is a global online gaming company with millions of customers worldwide. And owns some of the worldâs leading online gaming brands, including : bwin, partypoker, partycasino and Foxy Bingo. I was executing briefs for all Brand elements in the business;ï¿½ making sketches and producing conceptual designs to specific commercial or promotional needs. Creating designes for an international audience, considering localization for different cultures, including copy that translated and published in more than 22 languages worldwide.

In this example the request was to design an International Festive Seasonal Promotion for VIP Poker Game Club Players.ï¿½ The players would enjoy an element of surprise, every time they collect specific amount of points in the promo period.ï¿½ They will receive a Card, which will award a random Bonus or Prize.

One of the challenges I faced is to create a festive winter feeling but to avoid mentoring âChristmasâ for the reason of different cultures worldwide.
  
But at the same time to design a Winter Wonderland look and feel that would support Brand&#8217;s green colours.

&#8211; I created a night winter scene that feels frosty and frozen somewhere on the Northern Arctic with the Northern lights.
  
With an open gift box and âHot Prizesâ that melt in the snow.

Anotherï¿½ request was to design a Christmas Seasonal Promotion for VIP Poker Game Club Players in France. The players would enjoy an element of surprise, every time they collect specific amount of points in the promo period. They will receive a Card, which will award a random Bonus or Prize. I designed a green background, while the spiral shaped lights, that reminds a Christmas Tree in the middle of the banner, direct the focus of the attention, to attract the players with the prizes. I used a Green Branded colors with contrasted dark and lighted areas to highlight the prizes and the text: Christmas Wishlist
