#### How to combine the different Brands of TJX into one app ?!
<br>

The TJX Company is one of the leading apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S. and worldwide.  TJ-Max, Marshalls, Home Sense, Winners, Sierra and more are all part of TJX Companies.  
I was involved in designing their internal App for in-company restaurant and food market orders. 
Based on the TJX website, I pulled out all their primary Brands' colors with their secondary colors palette. 
The colorful logo represents the combination of their different Brands under one. 
In the App icon, I used the TJX shades of red colors with - X- lines that cross the background. 
The Intro screens and the main page menu use each one of the TJX Brand colors. 
Still, even by using the different colors, all the backgrounds are consistent repeat with the X gently on the background and I was keeping the design simple, readable and accessible.
