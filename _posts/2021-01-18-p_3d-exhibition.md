Working as an Exhibition Designer in [Barzilai Design](http://www.barzilaidesign.com/), I had the chance to experience one of the most challenging, dynamic and exciting projects. With hands-on experience of high-quality 3D modeling and rendering. I was working from the initial brief, brainstorming with other team members, sketching and 3D modeling Interior spaces. At the same time, responsible for designing large print graphics and Branded elements for Marketing products and world Exhibitions for international clients/audiences all over Europe.

Kramer Electronics has a line of over 1,000 innovative products and exhibitions worldwide. Their booth was designed to specific Brand's requirements. They wanted to have a portable booth with four departments: Tools, Home, New collections and Meeting area. A welcome stand with a bar in the meeting area and screens on all sides.  
With a particular place for their sub-company; Sierra brand. 

One of the biggest challenges was how to design a movable, disassembled booth that creates interaction but at the same time attractive for business visitors. With functional solutions for hidden storage places.
  
The Bar has been planned in the center of the booth, with 360 degrees access, to make it inviting and attractive for more visitors to come & see the booth. From the bar area, the visitor could observe all the different departments and watch the displays.
