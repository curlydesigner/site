The main goal was to create an intuitive and simple login process for customers of the SotiaBank mobile app, with careful considerations to address specific needs:

6. Accessibility and Inclusivity: Ensure the login user flow is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, by implementing features like VoiceOver support for visually impaired users.

#### CHALANGES

Security Concerns: Balancing security measures without compromising user experience and striking the right balance between strong security and seamless user flow.

User-Friendly Biometrics: Integrating biometric authentication seamlessly can be tricky, as some devices might have varying biometric sensors, and not all users might be comfortable using them.

Compatibility and Device Variation: Designing for various devices and screen sizes while maintaining a consistent user experience can be challenging.

Password Management: Encouraging users to create strong passwords and securely manage them can be a challenge in itself.

Handling Errors: Providing clear error messages without revealing too much sensitive information can be a delicate task.

Regulatory Compliance: Complying with banking regulations and data protection laws while delivering a smooth user experience requires careful consideration.

To address these challenges, collaboration between UX designers, security experts, and developers is crucial. Regular user testing and feedback can help identify potential pain points and improve the login user flow iteratively. Additionally, staying updated with the latest UX design trends and security practices will aid in creating a successful and secure login user flow for the Bank mobile app.
