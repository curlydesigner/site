#### CHALANGES

- One of the challanges were around the Security concerns and how to balance betweeen security measures without compromising on user experience for a seamless user flow.

- Creating user-friendly biometrics: Integrating biometric authentication seamlessly can be tricky, as some devices might have varying biometric sensors, and not all users might be comfortable using them. 

- Consiering responsive design for various devices and screen sizes while maintaining a consistentcy and accessabilty.

- Password Management: ensuring proper feedback for users to create strong passwords and securely management. 

- Handling Errors: Providing clear error messages without revealing too much sensitive information.

- Complying with banking regulations and data protection laws while delivering a smooth user experience that requires careful consideration.

<br>

To address these challenges, I was collaborating between the different teams, Product owners, Security experts, and Developers. To gather feedback that can help identify potential pain points and improve the login and user flow iteratively.
