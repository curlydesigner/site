<br>
Working part of the Universal Lab Studio, supporting Scotiabankâ€™s mobile iPad App. Designing wireframes and interactive prototypes for a facing iPad application that redefines the future of banking and leveraging cutting-edge technologies.

<br>
This map was created for a logical and easy-to-follow structure that allows players to access different sections efficiently. 
Exploring other game HUDs and looking to simplifying navigation to help players quickly locate the information they need and understand the game space they're in. 

<br> Top Bar focuses on the player, allowing the player to explore their character and see who they are in the gameplay.
Also, explore the world beyond the map and setup their game settings.
Left side focuses on the player's goals, while on the right, where the player can take action. 
In my design considiration the main most important elements/links located on the sides of the screen and are adapted for maximum thumb-finger size tap.
