### BLACKBERRY SECUSUITE


#### IXD | USER FLOW | DESIGN PROPOSAL 

<br>

#### OVERVIEW

<br>

AtHocÂ® is part of BlackBerry Security systems for critical event management. It gets timely information to teams and the public and helps government agencies prepare for, respond to and recover from critical events and emergencies.
I led the UX re-design for AtHoc, researching competitors, creating wireframes, user flows, illustrating icons and design guidelines that can be used across the team. Involved throughout the entire product life-cycle, understanding human factors, functionality and focusing on usability and friendly interactions. 

<br>


#### UX GOALS - TRUSTWORTHY | PREMIUM | APPROACHABLE

<br>

-  Good usabilty insights and confidence trust

-  Simple and well structured UI but at the same time attractive design to increase the use.
