### *How to design a customer feedback experience and turn casual customers into lifelong consumers ?!*
<br>

Customer feedback is so important because it provides marketers and business owners with insight that they can use to improve their products and their overall customer experience. 

   I was observing how customers interact in the cafeteria space, asking questions and gathering their feedback to learn how the company can satisfy their needs during their interest in peaked moments. When are those moments, and how could consumer needs be satisfied when they want something but are limited in their ability.

How do we make sure customers have a satisfying experience the moment they walk into a business? And how to make sure it doesn't drop by keeping it positive, so the customer has a good impression throughout their experience from start to when they leave. The experience will influence whether customers will come back or not, based on the interaction they had (or lack of it).

Feedback is the only way to guarantee the company can create a product or service that customers want to buy.


From the Customer Journey map, it's obvious that a good place for the Kiosk would be at the end of the check-out process or during the purchase or mobile payment.

These are two wireframe options for customer feedback; one that could go on a tablet screen and one part of a mobile App.
