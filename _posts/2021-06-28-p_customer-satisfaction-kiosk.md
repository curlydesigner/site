### *How to design a customer feedback experience and turn casual customers into lifelong consumers ?!*
<br>


#### Overview 


This case study was part of my experience while working in Compass Digital Labs. One of the largest companies at the intersection of hospitality and technology. 

Customer feedback can be important in all fields but especially in hospitality because it provides marketers and business owners with insight that they can use to improve their products and their overall customer experience.

#### Persona and Customer Feedback Gathering 



I observed how customers interact in the cafeteria space, asking questions and gathering their feedback to learn how the company can satisfy their needs during their interest in peaked moments. When are those moments, and how could consumer needs be satisfied when they want something but are limited in their ability.

<br>


#### Challenges 


-  How does a business make sure customers have a satisfying experience the moment they walk into a coffee shop or a restaurant? 

-  And how to make sure the satisfaction doesn't drop? 

-  How to keep the experience positive, so the customer has a good impression throughout their stay from start to after they leave?

-  The experience will influence whether customers will come back or not, based on their interaction (or lack of it).

#### Journey Map

Feedback is one of the ways how to guarantee the company can create a product or service that customers want to buy.

After taking time and observing the interaction within the space, creating the Journey map, it becomes evident that a good place for Customer Feedback would be at a Kiosk station, part of the check-out process, or during mobile payment purchase.

#### Low & Mid-Fidelity Wireframes & Design Proposal 



I explored two design wireframes proposals, considering the different platforms options and screen sizing. One proposal with a design for a tablet screen and another for a mobile App.
