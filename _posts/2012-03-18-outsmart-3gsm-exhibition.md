By working as an Exhibition Designer in [Barzilai Design][1] a compnay who produces visual communication for world Exhibitions, with international clients all over Europe. I had the chance to experience one of the most challenging, dynamic and exciting projects. With hands on experience of high- quality 3D modeling and rendering. I was working from the initial brief for Kramer Electronics Brand &#8211; a company who founded to enter the video era, with a line of over 1,000 innovative products and exhibitions all over the world. The booth was designed to a specific Brands&#8217;s requirements to have a portable booth with four departments: Tools, Home, New collections and Meeting area. And with a special area for Sierra brand (sub-company).

One of the biggest challenges was to design a movable, disassembled booth that creates interaction, but at the same time innovative and attractive for business visitors. With functional solutions forï¿½ hidden storage place.
  
In the center of the booth I chose to design an open bar area with 360 degrees access, to make it inviting and attractiveï¿½ for more visitors to come & see the booth. From the bar area the visitor could absorve all Kramer\`s departments and watch the shown displays.
