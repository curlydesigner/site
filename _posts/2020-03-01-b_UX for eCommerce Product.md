### Do aesthetics have anything to do with usability?

Now that the market has completely changed, many businesses are moving online. Making it easier to discover and purchase products from anywhere in the world. Online shopping can be more efficient, reducing environmental waste and increasing overall productivity. However, that means a website or an app is the first interaction between a seller and a potential customer. It's not just about having an e-commerce website or an online shop, but about a virtual relationship between a seller and a potential customer. It is about creating an experience that simplifies the processes, increasing efficiency and keeping customers engaged.

With the explosion of content and a highly competitive market - Time is money! Consumers are taking the time to research and compare what they're buying. And increasingly selective with their choices; looking for good services and prices to make sure their money spent well. Mobile or/and desktop experience, companies need to communicate their information quickly enough and delivering values in a meaningful way that leaves a smile.

Businesses may offer similar products and services, however, not the same user experience and design. Meaningful and robust Brand identity with proper attention to design details could gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Excellent user experience is about the proper functionality and accessibility that is easy to use and navigate. Appealing with a user-friendly design; that invites and makes the purchasing process as intuitive as possible. 

Countless things need to be considered when creating an eCommerce website, some of them: 
- Logo header, menu items and product categories
- Navigation and CTA (call-to-action) buttons
- High-quality product images and photography that allows users to enlarge and browse the product, with clear information and product features. 
- Easy access to the shopping cart and checkout process 
- Any pop-up information, promotion email, or newsletters 

During my experience, I have explored many websites, but those which are truly inspiring are the ones that have; simple style, quick and easy flow, where eco-branding shines and the product is a king.

[Green House](https://www.greenhouse.ca/) an organic beverage company I just adore. They don't just make healthy drinks that taste good but also plastic-free using bottles from sustainable glass. Labeling all the healthy ingredients that benefit for the body, energy level and immune system. Every product is labeled with a unique name and organized into categories of benefits to the body. The label uses a neutral color and consistent design on a glass bottle where everything is transparent and represents a genuine clean product.
The website is so minimalist, easy to navigate and clean. Even the logo is so simple and gently presented in the center, not overlapping or distracting from the content. The background is pure white and clean, while the high quality of the bottles in 3D photos with a reflection on the bottles gives it beautiful rainbow colors inspired by a combination of fresh greens, veggies and fruits.

 [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) Apple has one of the most recognizable brands. They provide a wide selection of products and offer good services and support. Nevertheless, their website, as their products - simple, minimalist and intuitive. Every product they offer is proudly showcased on a separate page. It receives full attention and feels like a very expensive and unique diamond you want to try. They get the customer's attention with gentle visual appeal, harmonious colors and simple typography. The user is not distracted by anything but the product itself, only a few items that direct the user exactly where needed. And mostly, it's not just because Apple's website is so usable. We know Apple's success story, when Steve Jobs contributed with his phenomenal design thinking and creativity; by being different and making us act differently in the way that we enjoy it due to its ease of use and functionality.
 
But when considering environmentally conscious companies. Manufacturing mobile phones have a lot of impact on the Environment. As a technology company, Apple seems to take steps to reduce its impact on climate change. Also running its stores, offices and data centers on 100% renewable energy. The company also offers to take old products, promoting a trade-in program. However, that doesn't include broken products or very old devices. So it's both consumer responsibility and tech companies to make sure they create high-quality, safe products that last longer and can be fixed at a reasonable price.

And speaking about revolutionary breakthroughs, there is so much to say about [Tesla](https://www.tesla.com/en_ca/). They are not just rethinking cars as we know them but also redefining the car buying experience. 
The website showcases a beautiful, top-quality image gallery and an in-depth look behind Tesla's innovation and cutting-edge technology. If you are new to electric vehicles, you can learn everything you need to know about how it works. But if you are ready to buy - you can easily do it online. The models are organized into different types, accessible through the menu. And giving the option to customize your preferred features, choosing a favorite paint color, wheel type and interior style. 
Potential customers can see a purchase price and potential savings as they create their customization.  And at the end, choose a preferred payment method; cash, loan, or lease.

When designing a website, I always take the time to research the industry standards and competitors, considering brand values, target audience and usability requirements. Good marketing may bring in some traffic, but good design and an enjoyable user experience improve user satisfaction. The goal is to create a website that will be easy to use and effective.
Ensuring safety, leaving a trustful and positive experience from the user's perspective. All of those could influence the success of a company's website and the Brand's impression. You may not have a second chance to make a good first impression!
