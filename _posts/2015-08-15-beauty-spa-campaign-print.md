This Campaign designed forï¿½ SharpLight Canada (part ofï¿½ American Laser Clinics group) &#8211;ï¿½ Beauty and Skin Careï¿½ aesthetic industry with more than 100,000 clients all over the world. Therefore, it was a challenging and demanded client.

I was working within Design&Shoot- a Branding and Photography studio, with clients in Europeï¿½ and North America.ï¿½ My duties include producing and designing graphics, advertising and marketing materials. For Spa, Magazines, Packaging, Exhibitions, Leaflets, Brochures, Posters, Holiday and Sale Postcards, Roll-ups, Stationery Presentations, web and online materials.

I was managing more than one design brief at a time, through individual work with the SharpLight\`s representative Manager, a Copywriter, a Developer and Print Departments. Creating well-rounded designsï¿½ which match-up everybody\`s high standards. At the same time I was very involved in other projects, assisting to the Art Director, the Photographer and other Designers in the studio when needed.
