### Colour and Accessibility / Dark and Light Themes


<br> ![color](/assets/posts/2020-01-01-bp_Colour_Accessabilty_DarkLight/AdobeStock_248573161.jpeg "color")<br>

In 2019 Apple and Google introduced the Dark mode themes for their OS. Since then, many apps have developed with dark mode options. Promisisng that it might improve battery life, contributing to improving visibility for users with low vision and those who are sensitive to bright light and make it easier for anyone to use a device in a low-light environment. Even when Dark Mode wasn't yet a thing, let's not forget the first computer screens were already in "dark mode".
But before all that, our eyes get used to reading books with dark text on a white background. But this is when we were working and studying during the day and sleeping at night.  Nowadays, when we use our devices around the clock, users want to have the possibility to customize their devices, giving our eyes a rest and adjusting it to our use habits for a better digital environment. 

Working a lot with developers, it seems like Dark theme contributed a lot with its design becoming more useful for coding. It can be more restful to the eyes from extended screen time and allows seeing the structure of the code with the coloring elements highlighted. It pops out the different components, allowing the ability to scan quickly instead of reading through every word. 

But not everyone feels more comfortable, less tired and more focused while using Dark Mode. It also requires specific accessibility guidelines to consider: 

While working on a design for dark theme guidelines, I considered the different levels of content on a dark mode for card-based design. 
Shadows cannot be perceived the same as with the light theme. So its important to experiment with different shades of grey that can help to communicate visual hierarchy. Avoiding using 100% black because pure black is too hard on the eye.  

Color contrast and tones used on a dark theme are vital for all users but especially for people with poor vision or disabilities. Users must be able to perceive content. This is why colors selected for text and icons need to be contrasted and readable and carefully used if there are gradients, semi-transparent colors, and background images. Everything has to be designed carefully and meet the contrast requirements. 

Accessibility is something I never skip, especially when it's a dark mode design. For example, saturated colors should be avoided as they are not readable and 
There are useful websites where color accessibility could be tested. 

[WEBAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) has a contrast ratio checker for text and graphic objects. You can enter a foreground and background color in RGB hex format or choose a color using the color picker.  And it will give you ratio results for WCAG AA and WCAG AAA
