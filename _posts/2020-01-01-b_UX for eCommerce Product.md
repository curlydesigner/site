Now that the market has completely changed, many businesses are moving online. Making it easier to discover and purchase products from anywhere in the world. Online shopping can be more efficient, reducing environmental waste and increasing overall productivity. However, that means a website or an app is the first interaction between a seller and a potential customer. It's not just about having an e-commerce website or an online shop, but about a virtual relationship between a seller and a potential customer. It is about creating an experience that simplifies the processes, increasing efficiency and keeping customers engaged.

With the explosion of content and a highly competitive market - Time is money! Consumers are taking the time to research and compare what they're buying. And increasingly selective with their choices; looking for good services and prices to make sure their money spent well. Mobile or/and desktop experience, companies need to communicate their information quickly enough and delivering values in a meaningful way that leaves a smile.

Businesses may offer similar products and services, however, not the same user experience and design. Meaningful and robust Brand identity with proper attention to design details could gain a sustainable competitive advantage. Excellent user experience is about the proper functionality and accessibility that is easy to use and navigate. Appealing with a user-friendly design; that invites and makes the purchasing process as intuitive as possible. 

Here are a few environmentally friendly eCommerce websites with a simple style, quick and easy flow, where - branding shines and the product is a king.


[Green House](https://www.greenhouse.ca/) an organic beverage company I just adore. They don't just make healthy drinks that taste good but also plastic-free using bottles from sustainable glass. Labeling all the healthy ingredients that benefit for the body, energy level and immune system. Every product is labeled with a unique name and organized into categories of benefits to the body. The label uses a neutral color and consistent design on a glass bottle where everything is transparent and represents a genuine clean product.
The website is so minimalist, easy to navigate and clean. Even the logo is so simple and gently presented in the center, not overlapping or distracting from the content. The background is pure white and clean, while the high quality of the bottles in 3D photos with a reflection on the bottles gives it beautiful rainbow colors inspired by a combination of fresh greens, veggies and fruits.

 [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) has one of the most recognizable brands and uses phenomenal design. They provide a wide selection of products and offer good services and support. Nevertheless, they keep their website the same as their products - simple, minimalist and intuitive. Every product they offer is proudly showcased on a separate page. It receives full attention and feels like a very expensive and unique diamond you want to try. They get the customer's attention with gentle visual appeal, harmonious colors and simple typography. The user is not distracted by anything but the product itself, only a few items that direct the user exactly where needed, without leaving any dead-ends. And mostly, it's not just because Apple's website is so usable and their products are so beautiful. The main reason for their success is their whole creative thinking approach; by being different and making us act differently in the way that we enjoy it due to its ease of use and functionality.
 
 But when considering environmentally conscious companies, how much Apple eco-friendly? As a technology company, Apple does show importance in making steps to reduce its impact on climate change. Also running its stores, offices and data centers on 100% renewable energy. The company also offers to take old products, promoting a trade-in program. However, that doesn't include broken products or very old products. So it's both consumer responsibility and tech companies, to make sure they create high-quality, safe products that last longer and can be fixed at a reasonable price.
