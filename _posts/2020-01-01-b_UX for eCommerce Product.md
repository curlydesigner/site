Now that the market has completely changed, many businesses are moving online. Making it easier to discover and purchase products from anywhere in the world. Online shopping can be more efficient, reducing paperwork, environmental waste and increasing overall productivity. However, that means a website or an app is the first interaction between a seller and a potential customer. It's not just about having an e-commerce website or an online shop, but about a virtual relationship between a seller and a potential customer. It is about creating an experience that simplifies the processes, increasing efficiency and keeping customers engaged.

With the explosion of content, consumers take the time to research and compare what they're buying. People are increasingly selective with their choices and look for good services and prices to make sure their money is spent well. From furniture suppliers to financial consultancies, Sellers need to communicate their information quickly enough with a user experience that leaves a smile.

Excellent user experience design is about the proper functionality and accessibility that is easy to use and navigate. Mobile or/and desktop experience that attracts the right people to a Brand and delivers values in a meaningful way. An appealing, user-friendly design; that attracts and invites users to shop. Making the purchasing process as intuitive as possible.

With the emerging growth of technology, it's a competitive market, and many startups focus on providing the best product, technology and service at a competitive price. Developing business plans and investing heavily in good internet marketing. However, at the same time, neglect UX research, design thinking, visual appeal and user journey. As a result, all that hard work is put at risk when users get lost, lose interest and neglect. Usability problems may cause disappointment and the visitor to leave immediately. Simultaneously, a meaningful and robust Brand identity with proper attention to design details could gain a sustainable competitive advantage.

Time is money! In today's highly competitive market, many business websites may offer similar products and services however not the same user experience and design. Getting noticed requires standing out.

Here are a few eCommerce websites with inspiring examples of simple style, quick and easy flow, where branding shines and the product is a king.



 [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) has one of the most recognizable brands and uses phenomenal design. They provide a wide selection of products and offer good services and support on their website. Nevertheless, they succeed in keeping their website simple, minimalist and straightforward. Every product they offer is proudly showcased on the website. It receives full attention and feels like a very expensive and unique diamond you will want to try. They get the customer's attention with gentle visual appeal, harmonious colors and simple typography. The user is not distracted by anything but the product itself, only a few items that direct the user exactly where needed to go without leaving any dead-ends. And mostly, it's not just because Apple's website is so usable and their products are so beautiful. The main reason for their success is their whole creative thinking approach; by being different and making us act differently in the way that we enjoy it due to its ease of use and functionality.
