### Do aesthetics have anything to do with usability?

Now that the market has completely changed, many businesses are moving online. Making it easier to discover and purchase products from anywhere in the world. Online shopping can be more efficient, reducing paperwork, environmental waste and increasing overall productivity. However, that means a website or an app is the first interaction between a seller and a potential customer. It's not just about having an e-commerce website or an online shop, but about a virtual relationship between a seller and a potential customer. It is about creating an experience that simplifies the processes, increasing efficiency and keeping customers engaged. 

With the explosion of content, consumers take the time to research and compare what they're buying. People are increasingly selective with their choices and look for good services and prices to make sure their money is spent well. From furniture suppliers to financial consultancies, Sellers need to communicate their information quickly enough with a user experience that leaves a smile. 

Excellent user experience design is about the proper functionality and accessibility that is easy to use and navigate. Mobile or/and desktop experience that attracts the right people to a Brand and delivers values in a meaningful way. An appealing, user-friendly design; that attracts and invites users to shop. Making the purchasing process as intuitive as possible. 

With the emerging growth of technology, our preference as consumers changes within a blink of an eye. It's a competitive market, and many startups focus on providing the best product, technology and service at a competitive price. Developing business plans and investing heavily in good internet marketing. However, at the same time, neglect UX research, design thinking, visual appeal and user journey. As a result, all that hard work is put at risk when users get lost, lose interest and neglect. Usability problems may cause disappointment and the visitor to leave immediately. Simultaneously, a meaningful and robust Brand identity with proper attention to design details could gain a sustainable competitive advantage.

Time is money! For Business to Client relations and especially Business to Business relations, the consumer would be highly demanding and expect to have a very satisfying experience and good service. Research shows that business clients would prefer to invest their money on brands because of their perceived reliability and can save you time and money.
In today’s highly competitive market, many business websites may offer similar products and services however not the same user experience and design. To get noticed requires standing out.

Here are a few essential factors to consider when creating an eCommerce website with inspiring examples of simple style, quick and easy flow, where branding shines and the product is a king. 


 [Apple](https://www.apple.com/) who has one of the most recognizable brands and uses phenomenal design. They provide a wide selection of products and offer good services and supports to the clients on their website. Nevertheless, they succeed in keeping their website simple, minimalist and clear. Every product they offer is proudly showcased on the website. It receives full attention and feels like a very expensive and unique diamond you will want to try. They get the customer’s attention with gentle visual appeal, harmonious colors and simple typography.
The user is not distracted by anything but the product itself. There is no unnecessary text and content, no ‘frills, bells and whistles’, only a few items that direct the user exactly where he or she needs to go without leaving any dead-ends. As a result, the user does not get lost on the website, an is encouraged to browse more and more. And mostly it’s not just because the Apple’s website is so usable and their products are so beautiful. The main reason of their success is their whole creative thinking approach; by trying to be different and make us act different, in the way that we really enjoy it due to its ease of use, functionality and creative environment that it provides.

  There are so many things to consider when building the perfect website experience. And a set of rules to help create a unified identity when connecting multiple elements of your Brand by defining your colors, your logo and, of course, your typography. 
Fonts may seem like a small thing, but it has a lot of power you should not underestimate when considering typography. Picking the right font can have a significant impact on the final look and feel of your website. But remember to be consistent throughout all your platforms and printed materials regarding color, style, font sizes, and the hierarchy. 
Free people used an excellent combination between custom handwritten typography and a modern sans/serif font. Which gives a balanced look that’s both timeless and modern and works perfectly with the freestyle concept.

  

I love [Desigual](https://www.desigual.com/en_CA/)! It is a simple design layout with a beautiful, large, full-width banner that immediately tells a story as you land on their homepage. The welcome message "Hello Summer" focuses on the new beachwear collection. And the scene of a jumping model on the summer beach background triggers emotions of fun, energetic and positive mood.
