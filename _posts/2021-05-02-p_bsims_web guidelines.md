#### Design Guidlines for BlackBerry Security Web Portal. 
<br>


When designing or redesigning a web portal, mainly for Government and Enterprise use, where security is fundamental, I dealt with many usability challenges. Where great focus and attention to detail has required. 
I led the portal's design and worked closely with a developer to optimize the system for best performance, focusing on simplicity and high functionality. Creating wireframes and architecture flow with simple ui and iconography. Navigation on the left led visitors to complete the desired action, but in an intuitive way. Icons got separate attention to identifying the menu actions with a focus on specific sizing color tones and consistent look. Keeping colors and text consistent and to a minimum, with visual hierarchy and Branded elements highlighted the essential content, like link buttons, error and communication messages. So that visitors naturally gravitate toward the most important elements and relevant actions first. Using BlackBerry's Brand values and color palate.
