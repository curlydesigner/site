What is CLEQ ?
<br><br>The CLEQ (Cinema Linked Entertainment Quiz) is one of my MA research projects. And it is a fun quiz, which tests people's personalities and temperaments while watching narratives with different Genres. The project's goal is to design an interactive maze game where people could test their temper. The user starts by watching a short narrative video with two main characters. It stops with an open ending while the user has two choices to make. For example: 'Return the keys' or 'Keep the keys'.
The project was made in London ;-) for educational and research purposes about user behavior. 
You can [try it yourself](http://www.cleq.curlydesigner.com/).
<br> The diagram shows an example of the folding possibilities in the interactive narrative. It's like a tree, which is a mixture of stories in a game-play. It leads to multiple limbs and has the potential to expand with an increasing number of variations. The player would need to play several times and repeat the different stems in the game to revile the content and all the possible endings.

 By the selections players make, the story navigates the narrative and the folding Genres. Those decisions will also influence the final test result of the player's character and temperaments.

The video is an Intro of the game; it starts with a short animation of a city's night scene and a live character who jumps behind the tree and welcoming the user to encourage him/her to join the experience and click to play.
  
The London panoramic night scene I designed is a view &#8216;like real&#8217;, however this view is a scene. &#8211; A combination of photographs I shoot at night time, of the representative points in the center of London (like the Big Ben, London Eye, etc ) I added a large moon, stars and a city reflation in a river.
  
The animation made with Photoshop, Illustration and After Effects.

[][1] While getting our own first experience in shooting, directing, producing and even acting in The CLEQ project, we have realized how difficult and sometimes unpredictable things could be. We have experienced two month of intensive and hard work, with tight timetable and only a few resources, we planed and produced the project from scratch. Which include: writing the script, finding and scheduling the right locations, shooting the clips, dealing with a light and weather problems, recording professional sounds, editing by a timeline with the video, importing, programming and designing everything until the last detail. And most importantly with a cooperative and great team work, managing to finish everything by the deadline.

It is important to add that all the people who took part in the project are non-experienced actors. The CLEQ is an innovative idea of two MA Interactive Design students of a research about: interactive narratives, games, menus, genres and their connection to people temperaments.
