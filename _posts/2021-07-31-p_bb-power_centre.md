<br>

#### Overview:

<br>

Power Center is a mobile app part of the BlackBerry HUB+ Suit products. That includes secure Inbox, Calendar, Notes, Tasks, Password, Battery Power Center & other Guardian Security apps.

#### UX GOALS 

<br>

-  The idea of the app is to allow users to manage the power settings on their device and set battery saving mode when battery power is low.

-  Showing an interactive battery level with information of any battery draining events. 

-  Showing an interactive battery level with information of any memory draining events. 

-  Showing any battery and memory events in a clear, actionable manner 

-  Designing an engaging app experience with useful information that can encourage returning users.

-  Build knowledge for better understanding and smarter predictions for user references of battery drainage.
