### BLACKBERRY ATHOC ALERT SYSTEM


#### IXD | INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE | USER FLOW | DESIGN PROPOSAL 

<br>

#### OVERVIEW

<br>

AtHocÂ® is part of BlackBerry Security systems for critical event management. It gets timely information to teams and the public and helps government agencies prepare for, respond to and recover from critical events and emergencies. I was leading the UX re-design for AtHoc, creating wireframes, user flows, illustrating icons and designing guidelines that can be used across the team. Involved throughout the entire product life-cycle, understanding human factors, functionality and focusing on usability and friendly interactions.

#### UX GOALS

<br>

-  Design responsive web based user registration flow- accessible from desktop and mobile. 

-  Simple and quick form with minimum info upfront. 

-  User information account allowing adding, editing and removing information later on. 

-  Designing an engaging and inviting experience that can encourage to subscribe.
