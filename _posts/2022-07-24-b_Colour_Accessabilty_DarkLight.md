### Colour and Accessibility - Dark and Light Themes Background
<br>

#### OVERVIEW

<br>


In 2019, Apple and Google introduced Dark mode themes for their OS, revolutionizing how users interact with their devices. Since then, dark mode options have become increasingly popular, with many apps adopting this design. The shift to dark mode has also brought various advantages, for potential battery life improvements making it easier for anyone to use a device in a low-light environment. 
<br>
<br>

Even when Dark Mode wasn't yet a thing, it still existed on the BalckBerry Devices. The concept of dark mode isn't entirely new, as it traces its roots back to the early days of computing when the first computer screens were already in "dark mode."

However, it gained significant traction when major tech giants officially integrated it. Before the computers, our eyes got used to reading books with dark text on a white background. This was when we were working and studying during the day and sleeping at night.

#### LEARNINGS 

Nowadays, when we use our devices around the clock, users want to have the possibility to customize their devices, giving their eyes a rest, especially during nighttime use. Dark mode makes devices in low-light environments more comfortable by reducing glare and preserving night vision. 


Working a lot with developers, it seems like Dark mode has proven to be highly beneficial. Beyond providing much-needed relief to their eyes during extended screen time, it also enhances the overall coding experience. The color-coded elements in dark mode allow developers to quickly discern the code structure, making identifying and differentiating components easier. This enables them to scan through code rapidly, improving productivity and reducing the time spent on reading each line.

#### CHALLENGES



- Text can be hard to read if color is not used properly 
- Colours can lack sufficient contrast and have accessibility issues. Colors behave differently on light vs. dark backgrounds, which means the color palette must be carefully designed to communicate the same message effectively.
- Dark UI doesn’t have the same breathing room as ‘white space’ on a light theme. Too many elements can quickly make the screen cluttered and busy.
- Not everyone likes dark theme

#### ACCESSABILITY 

The introduction of dark mode themes marked a significant turning point in user experience. Dark mode has evolved into a popular choice for its numerous benefits. But not everyone may feel more comfortable, less tired and more focused while using Dark Mode. Designing for a dark background requires specific accessibility guidelines to consider. I see many products that move into dark mode but neglacting accessabilty ratio.


<br>
<br>

Color contrast and tones used on a dark theme are vital for all users but especially for people with poor vision or disabilities. Users must be able to perceive content. This is why colors selected for text and icons need to be contrasted, readable and carefully used if there are gradients, semi-transparent colors, and background images. Everything has to be designed carefully and meet the contrast requirements.

Exploring card-based design in dark themes, I learned that maintaining visual hierarchy becomes essential. For example, shadows cannot be perceived the same as with the light theme background. Shadows play a significant role in conveying depth in UI, but their perception differs in dark backgrounds. I have been experimenting with different shades between Blacks and Greys to strike a balance and communicate effectively hierarchy that emphasizes elements based on their importance.



Accessibility is something I never skip. It has been especially essential to consider when working with a dark-mode design. For example, saturated colors should be used carefully, and darker-tone colors like red or brown might be hard to read. Those primarily found to be challenging to pass WCAG's accessibility standards.

###### Dark Theme Guidelines [Designed for BlackBerry Products](/dark-theme)  
<br>


[WEBAIM](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/){:target="_blank"} and [Contrast Checker](https://contrastchecker.com/){:target="_blank"} have a contrast ratio checker for text and graphic objects. You can enter a foreground and background color in RGB hex format or choose a color using the color picker.  And it will give you ratio results for WCAG AA and WCAG AAA.

<br>

When designing a product, I constantly research industry standards and competitors, considering brand values, target audience and usability requirements. While creating the Dark Theme Guidelines for BlackBerry Products, I also had the opportunity to investigate the different aspects and challenges of accessibility. Dark mode has evolved a lot but still can create many accessibility issues. For some people, dark mode is more accessible, for others, the white background would be preferable. The bottom line, users need to have customization, having both a dark and a light mode allowing the users to choose and making the switch easy to find.

Design is about functionality, and more thought should be given to accessible color choices when designing, both for dark and light screen modes. The goal is to create products that will be easy to use, accessible for everyone and effective. Ensuring a trustful and positive experience from the user's perspective and the company's impression.
