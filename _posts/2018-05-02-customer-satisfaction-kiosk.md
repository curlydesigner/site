Customer feedback is so importantï¿½ because it provides marketers and business owners with insight that they can use to improve their products and/or overall customer experience. And turn casual customers into life long consumers.

But how to design Customer Feedback experience ?

I was trying to observe how customers interact in the cafeteria space and listening to what they say. gathering theirï¿½ feedback to learn how can the companyï¿½ satisfy theirï¿½ needs during their interest in peaked moments?! When are those moments, and how can consumer needs could be satisfied when they want something but are limited in their ability.
  
Feedback is the only way to guarantee the company canï¿½ create a product or service that customersï¿½ actually want to buy.


  



  When A customer walks into a businessï¿½ &#8211;ï¿½ He orï¿½ She will have an opinion on the interaction that happened (or didnât happen).ï¿½ Customerï¿½ will come back or not based on that interaction (or lack). ï¿½ How do we have a full control over making sure the experience is a good one?



  



  From the Customer Journey mapï¿½ we can see that a good place for the Kioskï¿½ would beï¿½ in the end of the cheek-out process, or during the purchase.ï¿½ I wireframe two options for customer feedback; one that could go an a mobile kiosk screen and one inside a mobile App.ï¿½
